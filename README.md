Catalogue on-line for the Ki-mono Reconstruction project

This is a web-page which I make as a final project at the CodersLab front-end development course.
It's in progress.

I begin with a home-page and I'm going to move into particular subject pages.
All photos in the catalogue belong to Joanna Bodzek Studio.

The website is available on www.yumeandra.com.
