Wedding Kimono

The story


...The textiles were hand-woven specifically for the luxury ship, probably in the early 19th centry. I bought a basketful of them in an auction, and when I unpacked them I thought that these beautiful, thick fabricks resembled damask silks used for bridal garments in Shinto ceremonies. The idea to use cutlery as decoration occured to me when I first encountered the Japanese art of tea: I wondered what could happen if we brought our own cutlery to the table.
The WEDDING KI-MONO also reflects the roles in reltion to, and from, another person and his or her impact on our life, as well as the ultimate separation inherent to each reltionship. This is why I used cutlery connected with significant people and events in my life.
To make the decorative print and other 'embelishments of the kimono', I used original knoves and forks from the wedding gift received by my parents.

Chiyono

The story

...The fifty old cloths... are handmade products that carry dreams and memories, hours spent on preparingthe trousseau, embroidering initials on dish-cloths and bed linen.
We serve food on the table, the natural meeting place at home. The table is both inviting and disintegrating. The disintegration is part of a process that has a beauty of its own. The life between the bed and the table. Here we can undertake reflections on tradition and the family. Who are we? Are we living our visions and dreams? Kimono is the Japanese word for a 'thing to wear', 'clothing', i.e garments worn on a daily basis, also for cleaning and tidying.
The Polish and Swedish dish-cloths forming a Japanese woma's garment are an unexpexted combination. However, they complement each other, pointing to the traditional perception of the woman's role in dissimilar cultures.

Over-interpretation
In Japan, it is customary to reuse fabrics: to alter old kimono into smaller ones, and sew bags or dolls from small pieces of cloth. You can even find collections of fragments of precious fabric (e.g. theatre costumes) placed in albums or used to decorate screens.
The reuse of dish-cloths to create a garment potentially used in household chores invokes this custom.
The matter and the idea are one.

Kimono Exchangeable. Open Air

The story
...<br>The kimono with a printed image of bowls and friut was used in the art performance <a href="#">The Luncheon on the Grass</a>, where its initial role was that of the tablecloth/picnic  blanket for Irina eating friut from real plates. She donned it after the meal. The impulse to create this kimono was an image of a nude woman on whom food was served as it would on a table.

Over-interpretation
This is another answer to question about bringing cutlery to a Japanese table. The kimono becomes a table through the pattern placed on it and through the fact that it is spread in a way that is natural for it (on the grass), never ceasing to be a garment ready for wearing.

Tsunami
The story
...<br>In the small hours of 11 March 2011, the Japanese coast was hit by an earthquake and the resultant tsunami, tens of metres high, destroyed a number of cities, towns and villages in Fukushima Prefecture. <br>I decided to use these silks for a kimono that would become a memento of the tsunami. The kimono got broken so many times in the process of making it that I resolved to leave it forever unfinished. <br>Here is how a former cultural attachE to Stokholm commented on this story when I told it to him: 'This is in accord with the Japanese spirit: we strive for perfection while accepting the fact that it is unattainable.'<br><br>The tsunami nearly wiped out the town of Matsushima, whose beautiful sites had for centuries inspired poets, Matsuo BashO among them.<br>Hence the idea to make film <a href="#go to iframe with matsushima video">Matsushima</a>.

Doily Kimono. Tea Ceremony..
The story
...<br>I acquired the doilies on various occasions in Krakow, Stockholm and London. Out of nearly three hundred I could only use some seventy-eighty, which best fitted together.<br>If the time spent were to be charged at an artisant's hourly rate, the cost of the kimono would be some 64,000 zlotys (c. 16,000 euros), which is how much traditional Japanese garments actually cost.

Over-interpretation
The Japanese masters of traditional crafts begin their training as small children, under their parents' supervision. They do not switch to another discipline with every passing year; they spend years accumulating experience in their specific speciality. Once they are mature, experienced artisans, their works are perfect in form and well thought out in content.<br>The value of these works is in hundreds of hours of persistent work.

Onna-bugeisha
The story
...<br>In the end, I dicoveried how well it conveyed the various aspects of the feminine nature.

Over-interpretation
女 (onna) - woman<br>
武芸者 (bbugeisha) - master of military arts<br> An onna bugeisha is a woman-warrior, also referred to as a woman samurai. Such female warriors came from noble and samurai faielies, and when need arose fought in battle as bravely as men. <br>They would mostly use swords and spears. The iconic embodimentof the onna bugeisha concept was Empress JingU (c. 169-269) who led her deceased husband's armies to complete his conquest of Korea in 200.


Kimono tailored
Over-interpretation
The material and pattern of this kimono bring to mind a tailored pinstriped suit. The disinct white seams along the edges of the fabric and in the lower part of the kimono are a decorative element evoking an association with the edging of lapels, cuffs and pockects. The metal parts sewn onto the eri collar occupy the place traditionally intended for a chain watch.<br>Traditional kimono were unstitched before washing and then white, pronouncedly visible baste was used to sew them back together. in northern Honshu, the white seams would even take on the form of decorative patterns covering large fragments of the fabric.

Knitted kimono and obi
The story
...<br>In such wilderness,<br>you can feel a certain mood of insanity...<br>and a lot of wilderness...<br>This story continues to develop.<br>

Over-interpretation
The kimono made of fragments of yarn coming from various places and times gathers a lifetime's worth of memories. Perhaps they could be compiled to produce pleasant, harmonius images but life is not always nice and easy.
